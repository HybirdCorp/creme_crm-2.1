== Version 1.5 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # Mobile, a new app. It provides 3 views which are specifically adapted to the cellphones.
        - The 'Home' page displays the Activities in progress and the Activities of the days.
        - The 'Directory' page displays the favorite Contacts and Organisations (and their employees).
        - The 'Activities' page displays the delayed phone calls, the activities without date and the activities planned the next day.
        - You can search Contacts & Organisations, and create them.
        - When you click on a phone number, and come back to the browser at the end of the call, a workflow panel allows you to
          create a phonecall Activity (if it did not exist) and set its status.
        - The (alternative) login view is on the URL '/mobile/login/'.
    # Geolocation, a new app. It adds some geolocation features for the Contact and Organisation addresses.
      For the time being, it uses only GoogleMaps service. 3 new blocks are available :
        - "Maps" shows the location(s) of a Contact/Organisation in a map by using their addresses ; the latitude and the longitude can be manually dragged on the map.
        - "Maps By Filter" shows the locations of all Contacts or Organisations for a given filter.
        - "Around this address" shows all the neighbours of a selected address ; the neighbours can be filtered.
    # A detail view for the PropertyTypes, which shows the tagged entities, has been added.
    # The inner/bulk edition has been improved :
        - The widgets are the same the full form ones, and so :
            - The creator widgets are now used with configurable models (eg: Invoice.status).
            - The ForeignKeys to CremeEntities are now well managed (eg: Contat.image).
            - The ManyToManyFields are now supported (eg: Image.categories).
        - The form of a specific field can be customized in order to manage correctly its business logic (see 'Apps' section).
        - The support of related sub-fields (eg: Contact.billing_address__city) has been added.
    # List view :
        - The quick search on properties is now possible.
        - The natural ordering of the models is now applied as default for listview (eg: Organisation are ordered by their name).
          When a column is selected for ordering, both column order and default order are applied.
    # EntityFilters :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The conditions on FK fields (eg: Invoice.status) can now use a multi-selection.
        - The Empty/NotEmpty operators are enabled only when a field can be null.
        - The Date fields (regular & custom ones) now supports the Empty/NotEmpty operators.
        - The EntityFilters created by the 'populate' scripts (ie: not custom) are now editable (but not deletable, and their name is not editable); their are versionned too.
          Their owner is now the first super-user (in order not all users can edit them).
          The versionning means that when a populate script is run again, if the script tries to create a filter which already exists (ie: its PK exists) :
            - if the new version would have the same conditions, the name of the existing filter is updated (in order to fix a potential typo).
            - if the conditions are different, a new filter with the old one PK as base for its own PK (plus a version mark) is created ; the name is versionned too.
    # Listviews Views (HeaderFilters) :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The Views created by the 'populate' scripts (ie: not custom) are now editable (but not deletable).
          So, when the scripts are run again, the existing Views are not modified anymore (in order to keep the modifications of the users).
    # Global search :
        - The view uses now the GET method, so back button works well now.
        - The results blocks are now paginated.
        - The search on a model can be disabled in creme_config.
    # The CSV import can now set the CustomFields values.
    # You can now create an Entity "on the fly" with the multi-select widget for Entities.
    # A User and its related Contact are now synchonised (ie: first_name, last_name & email remain equal).
    # The autocompletion has been added to several forms, to select a content type or a relationship type.
    # The non mandatory instances are not re-created anymore when the command 'creme_populate' is run.
    # The ordering of models has been improved: lots of models are now ordered by name/title.
    # Apps :
        * Reports :
            - A Report can (again) be created with no column.
            - The download form has been improved.
            - The graphs can save a default chart (bar, pie, tube...) for their next rendering.
            - The number of queries computing the graph data has been reduced.
            - The field Report.filter can now be inner-edited.
            - The "volatile" links have been improved :
                - Their name is always up to date & localized.
                - When a link becomes invalid, the error is displayed in creme_config.
                - They can be any valid/compatible relationship/FK, and not only the ones which correspond to a column of the related Report.
            - The export view now uses GET parameters, so it can be bookmarked for example.
        * Activities :
            - The type of an Activity can now be edited (and not only its sub-type).
            - The Organisations of the participants can be automatically added as subjects (it can be configured and it is enabled by default).
            - The Activities can now be imported (ie: CSV/Excel files).
        * Persons:
            - You can now merge 2 Contacts if one of them is a user (but not 2).
            - A field 'order' has been added to StaffSize.
            - The field Organisation.siren is not unique anymore.
        * Creme_config :
            - You can not link an existing Contact when you create a User anymore.
            - SettingKey & SettingValue :
                - The values have a prettier display in their block (eg: 'True' is now a localized "Yes").
                - The descriptions are correctly localized.
            - The permissions for the views which configure RelationTypes, PropertyTypes, Blocks... have changed from 'creme_config.can_admin' to 'creme_core.can_admin'.
              The related portals do not need specific permissions anymore.
        * Commercial :
            - Commercial action :
                - A counted entity can be directly created with a quick form, from the objectives block.
                - A linked opportunity can be directly created from the 'Related opportunities' block.
        * Recurrents :
            - The field RecurrentGenerator.periodicity is now a DatePeriodField. It allows more accurate periodicity :
              for example, you can set a real 'monthly' period, which is not equal to 30 days.
            - The wizard form is now closer to other forms.
        * Emails :
            - The available sender address of the EmailCampaigns is now stored in a SettingValue.
        * Billing :
            - CSV import: in update mode, you can choose to update or not the addresses from the target.

            - A field 'order' has been added to Priority, Criticity & Status.
        * Projects:
            - A field 'order' has been added to ProjectStatus & TaskStatus.

  Developpers side :

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------

                    - Address._get_info_fields() (use Address.info_fields instead).
                * Creme_config:
                    - The auto increment of 'order' field in creme_config is deprecated (use a BasicAutoField instead).
        # A new model field has been added: BasicAutoField ; it's a PositiveIntegerField which uses an autoincremented value when no value is given
        # A new class, FieldInfo, has been added in order to replace the function get_model_field_info().
        # 2 new SettingKey types have been added : HOUR, EMAIL.
        # A new DatePeriod system has been added (with a related model & form fields).
        # A new decorator for the view is available : creme.creme_core.auth.decorators.permission_required
          It raises a 403 error (django.contrib.auth.decorators.permission_required redirects to login).
          Notice that login_required is available in creme.creme_core.auth.decorators too.
        # The database mutex tools have been improved :
            - A new decorator has been added : creme.creme_core.models.lock.mutex_autolock.

            * Reports :
                - A registry for types of charts (which allows to add custom ones) has been created.

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # Python 2.7 is now the only supported version.
        # Deprecated stuffes which have been removed :
            - The function creme_core.utils.Q_creme_entity_content_types().
            - Two methods in Opportunity: get_target() & get_source().
            - All the deprecated credentials methods in CremeEntity :.
                - can_change() & can_change_or_die()
                - can_delete() & can_delete_or_die()
                - can_link() & can_link_or_die()
                - can_unlink() & can_unlink_or_die()
                - can_view() & can_view_or_die()
                - populate_credentials()
            - The form fields _EntityField/CremeEntityField/MultiCremeEntityField and the associated widget ListViewWidget.
            - JavaScript:
                - creme.utils.simpleConfirm()
                - creme.utils.postNReload()
        # The 'user' argument was removed from several methods :
            - Relation.populate_real_object_entities()
            - CremeEntity.populate_relations()
            - EntityCell.populate_entities()
            - HeaderFilter.populate_entities()
        # The method CremeEntity.get_edit_absolute_url() now returns '' (and not an invalid URL anymore) which means 'No edition' ;
          the base templates/templatetags use this official behaviour (view_entity.html, {% get_edit_button ... %}).
        # _BulkUpdateRegistry.register() args have changed. It is not anymore a list of tuples (model, list_of_field_names),
          but now it allows to register only a model at once, an optionnal list of field names, and an optional dict of custom forms.
        # ManyToManyFields are now inner-editable by default ; so you have to manage them with bulk_update_registry.register(MyModel, ...)
          if it causes a businness logic problem (by excluding them, or adding a custom form for them).
        # SettingKey & SettingValue :
            - The SettingKey class is not a model anymore ; the SettingKey instances should be created
              in a setting_keys.py file and registered in your creme_core_register.py (see setting_key_registry).
            - The model SettingValue :
                - It has moved to creme_core (creme_core.models.setting_value.py).
                - The field  'key' (ForeignKey) has been replaced by a 'key_id' field (CharField) ;
                  so you could have to change some of your queries (eg: '.filter(key=MY_KEY)' --> '.filter(key_id=MY_KEY)').
        # HeaderFilter.create() :
            - It does not modify an existing HeaderFilter anymore.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user.
        # EntityFilter.create() :
            - If the argument 'is_custom' is False, you have to give the conditions as argument too (this is a new argument) ;
              a new filter is created if the conditions (or the 'use_or' field) are different ; if there are identitical, the name is updated.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user anymore.
            - The characters '[]' are now forbidden in the PK (ValueError).
            - The 'ct' & the 'is_custom' value can not be changed if there is already an existing filter (ValueError).
        # _FieldPrintersRegistry :
            - The functions registered as field printers take now an additional 'field' argument.
            - The attributes css_default_listview & css_default_header_listview have been removed.
            - The method get_listview_css_class_for_field() & get_header_listview_css_class_for_field() can not take 'None' as argument anymore.
        # Templatetags :
            - 'enumerate' has been removed.
            - 'print_boolean' always returns a boolean widget (it does not check if the argument is a boolean anymore).
        # CSV import : ImportForm._post_instance_creation() takes now an additional argument 'updated'.
        # Reminders :
            - The Reminder class has changed :
                - The attribute 'id_' has been renamed 'id'.
                - The attribute 'model_' has been renamed 'model'.
            - The models which can be reminded must have a boolean field called 'reminded' (so assistants.ToDo & assistants.Alert have been updated).
        # The class creme.creme_core.core.entity_cell.EntityCellRegularField has changed : the property 'field_info' returns now a FieldInfo instance.
        # The variable settings.SHOW_HELP has been removed.
        # Apps :
            * Recurrents :
                - The forms given to the registry must take a new 'ct' argument ; the 'initial' argument is not set anymore.

== Version 1.4 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The HeaderFilter (listviews Views) form has a new UI :
        - You can now choose the order for all columns.
        - The UI is more compact and friendly (filter, search, drag n' drop).
    # Customisable object & relation blocks. You can choose the same fields as in HeaderFilter form (& the UI is very close too).
    # EntityFilter :
        - A new condition is available for ForeignKeys to User : current user.
        - The operators are now filtered according to the selected field's type (regular & custom fields).
        - Enumerable field choices are now displayed in a combobox (instead of a simple text field).
    # CSV import can now update existing entities instead of always creating them ; you can select several fields that act as a key.
    # The 'Ice cream' theme has been improved again : better contrast, separation lines, drop shadows...
    # There are some User management enhancements :
        - The super users can now deactivate common users from creme_config (ie: in a graphical manner).
        - The field User.is_staff is now used by Creme : the staff users are hidden from other users, and they cannot be selected to own entities for example.
          The staff users are used to help the other users, but they should not participate in the business.
          Staff users are created by the django command 'createsuperuser' (but the first super user created after the syncdb command is not a staff user).
    # Minor UI improvements in forms :
        - Labels for submit buttons are now better ; for example 'Save the contact' instead of 'Submit' in the Contact creation form.
        - A 'Cancel' button is available in lots of forms.
        - A new JavaScript widget (CheckListSelect) is now used for multi-selecting without ordering : it uses check boxes and allows filtering/searching.
        - The order of the buttons in popups is now : OK/Cancel.
        - A new field to select several entities MultiCreatorEntityField replaces MultiCremeEntityField (but it does not allow inline creation yet).
    # Improved CSS for list views (fields are aligned differently according to their type).
    # A new pager for blocks has been added ; it manages large numbers of pages better.
    # A new command, called 'creme_uninstall', has been added : it can uninstall a Creme app in the good way.
    # A Unicode Collation Algorithm (derived from pyuca) is used to sort :
        - The apps in the menu, the creme_config portal, the UserRoles configuration.
        - The fields in the HeaderFilter form & in the search configuration.
        - The ContentTypes in <select>.
        - ...
    # JavaScript : some fallbacks for IE8 & 9 have been added. The support of IE 7 has been dropped.
    # The column titles in the list views are always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
    # The error handling in inner popups has been improved.
    # A view for 409 errors has been created.
    # Apps :
        * Polls, a new app :
            - You can create a PollForm, which contains questions organised in sections, sub-sections etc...
            - Questions have a type (string, integer, boolean, enumeration...).
            - Questions can have conditions on previous questions : a question is activated only if its conditions are filled.
            - You can create several PollReplies from a PollForm, which snapshot the questions of the form.
            - A PollReply can be filled with a wizard, and answers can be edited later.
            - The PollReplies can be grouped by PollCampaigns.
        * Reports :
            * When you create a new Report, you can only select the columns from an existing HeaderFilter.
            * A new UI for the columns edition has been added, and it uses the work on the new HeaderFilter form.
            * ReportGraphs :
                - The form has been improved. Example : the field 'Is count' is already checked if there is no available aggregable field.
                - Only the ForeignKeys related to enumerable models are available (see the notes on 'enumerable' tag below) for the abscissa.
                - CustomFields are now available for abscissa & ordinate.
                - The graph design has been heavily enhanced. The data is emphasized by a clearer display :
                  many useless/annoying visual elements were removed, legends are better, many glitches were fixed...
            * Several behaviours have been fixed :
                - The column titles are now always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
                - The 1st level entities are filtered by credentials ('view' permission).
                - When a FK field is linked to a sub-report, if a related entity does not pass the subfilter, the line is not dropped any more (related values are just empty).
                - The flattened sub-reports (ie not expanded, see 'selected' attribute) in columns associated to ManyToManyField/ForeignKey/related fields are now used.
                - The flattened sub-reports manage now all types of columns.
                - The aggregates are computed in a scope (so result may be different with an aggregate in a sub-report). 
            * Invalid columns are automatically removed (eg: removed CustomField).
        * Activities, the calendar has been heavily improved :
            * The version of fullcalendar.js has been updated from 1.4.5 to 1.4.7.
            * A new menu has been created, with :
                - Floating activities ; they can be drag n' dropped on the calendar, and filtered by their name.
                - All your calendars & the public calendars of all the other users.
                  Several calendars can be shown together (they have different colors) and they can be filtered by their name, or the first name and last name of their owner.
        * Billing :
            - The creation and the edition of billing lines have been redesigned, in order to use more client side computation.
            - A new field 'acceptation_date' (DateField) has been added to the Quote model.
            - A new field 'pending_payment' (BooleanField) has been added to the InvoiceStatus model.
            - 3 function fields are dynamically added by the 'billing' app to the models Organisation and Contact :
                - Total of pending payment.
                - Total number of won quotes this year.
                - Total number of won quotes last year.
        * Opportunities :
            - Opportunity.target field is now editable.
        * Products:
            - 'images' are now displayed in a true block (Products & Services).
        * Projects :
            - The Project.name field is not nullable anymore.

        # A new field tag has been created : 'enumerable'. When a ForeignKey is tagged as enumerable, it means that the related model

    # Documentation for people who want to install Creme on Windows.
    # Code clean-up (in .js files for example), lots of unit tests were added.
